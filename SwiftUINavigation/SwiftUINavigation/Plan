6. Connect Menu with module 1 and 2 with navigation

The way i did connect two screens with each other by pop() -> push() is working. Try to expand it

if i do transition from Room to Dungeon it mean we should save current room state before transition. So i will create two methods like "save state" and "transition to dungeon". Should i combine one in another and call it "saveAndTransition" or just "goToDungeon" will be enough?
